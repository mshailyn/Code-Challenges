# Code Challenges
A repo of all the extra code challenges I've been working on


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  JavaScript

For this I included three pages that look like they are apart of one. I kept the background the same across the pages to increase uniformity and connection between the pages. I timed my transitions on the home page to showcase my welcome message and contrasted it with its own background but made it something a bit more translucent. The java script utilized was to add breakpoints and make sure certain parts of the opening site would pre-load so the initial transition would look smooth.


## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. I learned alot about making some smooth transition on this website. I wanted my website to feel alive yet maintain a level of fluidity. I think I was able to accomplish this but I will still continue to work on it as my knowledge grows.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple of projects I've worked on:
